SOLID Principles

Single Responsibility
- A class should have one and only one reason to change
-- a class should have only one job/responsibility

Open closed
- Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification
-- a software entity must be easily extensible with new features without having to modify its existing code in use

Liskov Substitute
- objects must be replaceable by instances of their subtypes without altering the correct functioning of our system.
-- we should only extend classes and use interfaces or abstract classes if it makes sense. If you extend from a class or interface which have functions that you donâ€™t need. Then you have created an incorrectness.
